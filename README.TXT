Hello

#1 There are 2 boxes for the LabClass project and there is an arrown leading the LabClass diagram to the student diagram

#2 If you create a new class

#3 When you create a new object,delete objects, and enroll objects

#4 private instrutorTutor

#5 In the terminal it says "numberDi1.increment();"
In the inspector the private int limit is 24 and the private int value goes up when I increment. When I go over 23 it goes backto 0

#6 In the terminal it says "Minutes.increment();"
 When minutes reach the limit 59 and roll over to 0, that means one hour has passed. at that point I call the increment method on the hours object
 
#7 typed NumberDisplay display = new NumberDisplay(6);
to get value I need to write "display.getValue()" it is at 0
when I type the increment method the value goes up

#8 When I put the setValue at 3 the getValue is at 3
When I put a number greater than 24 the getValue stays at 3
it stays the same because it is over the roll limit

#9 I predict that the get value will be at 0

#10 I get Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context

#11 Error: '.class' expected

#12 if((replacementValue >= 0) && (replacementValue <= limit)) {
When it was < only the getValue was at 0
Now with the <= its at 10 because it of the equal so its like greater or equal than
